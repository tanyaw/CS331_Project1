This java program, SortingAlgsAnalysis, implements three sorting algorithms:
  1. Insertion Sort
  2. Mergesort
  3. Quicksort (using 3 different implementations)

We run several test cases to analyze the average runtime of each sorting 
algorithms on the same unsorted, randomly generated integer array of 
increasing size (from 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^16).
